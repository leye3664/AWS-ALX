Introducing Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

## Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab introduces you to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) by using the AWS Management Console. 

**After completing this lab, you should be able to:**
- Log in to the AWS Management Console
- Create an Amazon EFS file system
- Log in to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that runs Amazon Linux
- Mount your file system to your EC2 instance
- Examine and monitor the performance of your file system

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Creating a Security Group to Access Your EFS File System
Created a security group to allow inbound access for TCP on port 2049 for Network File System (NFS).

### Task 2: Creating an EFS File System
Configured an EFS file system and attached it to multiple EC2 instances in different Availability Zones.

### Task 3: Connecting to Your EC2 Instance via SSH
Connected to the EC2 instance using SSH from a Microsoft Windows system and a macOS/Linux system.

### Task 4: Creating a New Directory and Mounting the EFS File System
Mounted the EFS file system to the EC2 instance and examined available and used disk space.

### Task 5: Examining the Performance Behavior of Your New EFS File System
Used Flexible IO (fio) to benchmark the I/O performance of the EFS file system and monitored performance using Amazon CloudWatch.

## Detailed Steps

### Task 1: Creating a Security Group to Access Your EFS File System
1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2 > Security Groups.
2. Create a new security group with the following configurations:
   - **Security group name**: EFS Mount Target
   - **Description**: Inbound NFS access from EFS clients
   - **VPC**: Lab VPC
3. Add an inbound rule:
   - **Type**: NFS
   - **Source**: Custom (Security group ID of the EFSClient security group)

### Task 2: Creating an EFS File System
1. Navigate to EFS in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new EFS file system and customize it:
   - Uncheck Enable automatic backups.
   - Lifecycle management: None
   - Tags: Key - Name, Value - My First EFS File System
3. Attach the EFS Mount Target security group to each Availability Zone mount target.
4. Complete the setup and ensure the file system and mount targets are available.

### Task 3: Connecting to Your EC2 Instance via SSH

#### For Microsoft Windows Users:
1. Download and save the labsuser.ppk file.
2. Use PuTTY to connect to the EC2 instance with the downloaded key.

#### For macOS and Linux Users:
1. Download and save the labsuser.pem file.
2. Use the terminal to SSH into the EC2 instance with the downloaded key.

### Task 4: Creating a New Directory and Mounting the EFS File System
1. In the SSH session, create a new directory: `sudo mkdir efs`
2. Use the AWS Management Console to get the mount command and execute it in the SSH session.
3. Verify the mounted file system with `sudo df -hT`.

### Task 5: Examining the Performance Behavior of Your New EFS File System
1. Run the fio command to benchmark write performance.
2. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and analyze the performance metrics.



## Conclusion
Successfully created and configured an Amazon EFS file system, mounted it to an EC2 instance, and examined its performance using fio and CloudWatch.
